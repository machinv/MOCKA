### Contributing

MOCKA having been abandoned by its creators relies on volunteers to maintain it. Please consider contributing.

### Licensing

All compiler source code is released under the GPL license. All library source code under the LGPL license.

### Coding Standard

We use the coding standard of the Modula-2 Software Foundation's M2BSK project:

https://github.com/m2sf/m2bsk/wiki/Coding-Standard

However, since MOCKA is only supposed to be compiled using MOCKA itself, cross-dialect portability is not a goal.
No ISO Modula-2 version of modules that use casting is required. All source code is PIM only.

### Work Items

Please take a look at:

* the [scope of work file](./ver1808/AAA_SCOPE_OF_WORK.md) for the upcoming version
* the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) file of the project
