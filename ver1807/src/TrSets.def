   (* Processes set expressions.
      A set expression consists of a list of members; a member may be either
      a constant member (i.e. member is a constant expression or is a range
      with constant expressions as bounds) or a dynamic member (i.e. member
      is a variable or a range with at least one variable in the bound
      expressions).
      
      'MemberListNode' is the root of an SuTree subtree that
		       corresponds to a set
		       member list.
    
      'TypeOfSet'      is the member list's corresponding set type.

      'MemberListAttr' describes a set of type 'TypeOfSet' that includes the
		       members described by 'MemberListNode'.
    
      'MemberListOK'   returns TRUE, if all set members are semantically
		       correct (i.e. compatible with set base type).  *)
